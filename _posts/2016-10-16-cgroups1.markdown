Look at the title of this post, during the remaining lines of it you will be reading either about a 1930s fascist Italy special police 
corps or, of course, about a linux kernel feature, and I'll conclude complaining either about the intriguing ability of politicians to
put fancy names to their abominable ideas or about the hilarious inability of engineers to put a decent name to anything at all, including
their own children.

We've all seen the fuss around docker, lots of people have been talking about it in the recent years and some of them even know what they're 
talking about. Jokes aside, docker, and in general containers, whether you care or not, are heavily disrupting the scene and I 
just thought some of you might be interested in getting to know a little bit about some of the clever and sofisticated pieces of machinery 
that made it all possible. So, yes, going back to the title of the post, unfortunately we're talking about the much less violent option, 
the linux kernel feature.

We won't dive too deep so the concepts exposed won't be extremely complex, you don't need to know much about containers or about GNU/linux 
beyond the basics, let's roll.
